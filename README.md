I am a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. My passion lies in exploring human-centered design and leveraging technology to provide meaningful solutions to real-world problems. 

- In the future, I aim to create applications that address issues such as accessibility and community engagement. 
- Through my current endeavors, I strive to inspire and advocate for more women in STEM. 
- In my free time, you will often find me reading, listening to podcasts, or trying my hand at new baking recipes!
